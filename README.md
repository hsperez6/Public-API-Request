# Public-API-Request
 Fictional employee directory using fetch API requests, async/await, and modals.


In CSS, I changed the font color on .modal, .modal-text, and .card-text to black to increase contrast and make it easier to read.
I also changed the background color on .body to a light purple, and on .modal and .modal-btn-container to a light pink.
I added a box-shadow to each .card and a border to each .card-img.
